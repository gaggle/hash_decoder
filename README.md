# hash_decoder
Simple hash decoder experiment

Use the `--hint` option to reduce the search-space. 

E.g. if you're looking to break the hash `e4820b45d2277f3844eac66c903e84be`, 
and you know the anagram of the decoded phrase is "poultry outwits ants", 
it will be **significantly** quicker to let the system consume that hint.

See [CLI.md](CLI.md) for usage details.
